IRB
===
At Texas A&M, MRI studies are reviewed by full board, which meets monthly. Applications are due about a month before the meeting. The schedule of meetings is `available here <https://vpr.tamu.edu/compliance/rcc/irb/schedule>`_.

Personnel
---------
Techs (i.e., Vidya) need to be added to study personnel. 

Consent
-------
The Research Compliance office has several templates for consent forms `available here <http://rcb.tamu.edu/humansubjects/forms/templates>`_. These templates don't contain language regarding data sharing, which is becoming the norm for the MRI community. There's an excellent discussion of data sharing available `here <https://open-brain-consent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, including a template for a consent that allows for permissive data sharing. The Texas A&M IRB has approved permissive data sharing language. Data must be de-identified before sharing, including scrubbing the dicom headers for identifying information and elimination of identifying facial/dental features. There are easy to use tools available for doing so `anonymization tools <https://open-brain-consent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/anon_tools.html>`_.
